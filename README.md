# Godot VehicleBody Demo project

This is a Godot demo project in support of my vehicle body youtube tutorial videos.
- [Part one](https://youtu.be/B5vE-nNszxA)
- [Part two](https://youtu.be/Yvy8vQ-5O_w)

Part one works best with Godot 3.0.4 or newer. The other parts will require a recent Godot 3.1 build.
You will need to download this in order to run this project.
